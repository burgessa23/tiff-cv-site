While the previous owner of the project had done quite a bit of work, I had the disadvantage of not having a lot of background before being thrown into this project.. A lot of the styling was inconsistent and I had to go through and make sure that consistency was put in place, so that future revisions could be made easier.</p><p>Another added obstacle in the site revision, was that, there were few layout changes that could be made in the amount of time allotted. Aesthetic changes needed to be carefully considered, while maintaining business needs. The ask was for the site to have a lighter, more modern aesthetic, while allowing the product to shine. Simplicity was the approach that I took, in order to let the product speak for itself. Some minor navigation changes helped declutter the home page, while button colors were consolidated to reflect a more cohesive and consistent visual language.</p>",
